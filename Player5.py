Player 5:
Rule is: The computer first assigns a random value and the game starts.
If the user enters one of r s and t, it holds the values in an array. 
If the value is not entered, a warning message is displayed.
Counts and holds r, s, t.It calculates probability based on the values it finds.
according to this possibility the user finds the maximum option.
It makes  next choice based on this possibility.
